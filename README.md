About Me :)!

My Name is Yousef Mohammed. I am from Kuwait, and I am a computer engineering student at SDSU. I am interested
in learning more about software programming and web development. Currently, I am a working on a battery charger
project using a solar panel. In addition, I am working on a web app project with my group which is about a blog
of articles related to STEM majors. The idea of this web app is to allow registered users to add their own
articles and share their knowledge with other users to help them learn and introduce new topics to them. 

Favorite Hobbies:
1- riding motorcycles.
2- going to the gym.
3- exploring software programs and web development.
4- learning more about web development with my older brother.
